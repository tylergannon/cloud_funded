%h1.display How it works

%h3 Create your fundraising profile

%p 
  It all starts with your business and your story. Fill out the application so you can begin telling your community about what you do and how it works.

%h3 Engage your community in funding this venture

%p 
  Small businesses build their funding profile to show their company overview, the funding goal, and the rewards and returns they wish to offer in exchange for the support their backers offer. Begin by reaching out to your own networks: friends, family, customers, social connections, and the media. As you demonstrate traction by engaging each of this rings of supporters, more and more people will find and support the project from the broader CloudFunded community as well. 

%h3 Anyone can pledge money to fund a new enterprise

%p 
  CloudFunded members can choose to support any venture, with cash pledges starting at a $1 and up. Each business determines what rewards you get in return, everything from pre-release specials, custom & creative t-shirts, and celebratory dinners to feature requests, permanent recognition, or even an advisory role in the enterprise. 

%h3 Funders get engaged and help out

%p 
  Once you have your community’s support and people are opening up their wallets and checkbooks to chip in, then things really get interesting. With all these funders backing you, they can bring more than cash to the table. Funders can help attract new customers, get the word out when you have a milestone or launch announcement, and contribute in many other ways. This kind of volunteering and leadership is what makes community ownership and the crowd approach to creativity and funding so enjoyable!

%h3 Donation Campaigns Keep it All

%p 
  CloudFunded uses an open approach that provides flexible funding. Once you raise donor pledge money, you keep it. If your project will only be possible once you meet a minimum threshold, you can set that tipping point amount as a special campaign feature. When you set a minimum, if your project needs, for example, $3000 just to get started, you don’t have to worry about returning the money if the campaign doesn’t work out. You also have to set a campaign goal. There is no upper limit on how much you can raise. You do have to declare a target, but if you raise beyond your target amount, your campaign keeps going.

%h3 Awesome Rewards
%p 
  Your Funders get rewards for the pledges they give you. Take the time to make these rewards awesome. Remember you are starting or continuing a relationship with these people, the ones who like you and your idea enough to chip in and get it going. You want to have great rewards that they are excited about and want to tell others about. These are the folks who are going to be your customers, your word-of-mouth advertising, and your biggest fans. Reward your fans!

%h3 A Goal and a Plan

%p 
  Set the right goal for exactly what you need to accomplish. If you don’t know how much you need, think and write about it and sketch out your plans until you know. People want to give to something concrete, where they have clear grasp of what you can deliver and how are going to do it. You owe it to yourself and your community to set the right goal, so you can all rally around it together. Remember, unlike other platforms, you aren’t penalized for missing your goal and nothing is stopping you from meeting your goal and charging right past it to greater success. What matters is that your funding goal is attached to a clear plan that you are ready to carry out.
