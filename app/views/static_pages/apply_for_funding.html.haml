  We want anyone and everyone doing good work in this world to get involved and use these tools to get access to the resources they need. 

%h3 What is the Process?
%p 
  Every project starts by creating their listing to get funded. You can begin your application and launch it, then come back to continue to fill in more details and improve it. We allow you to save your progress every step of the way, so get started now. 

%h3 Got Awesome Rewards?
%p 
  Your Funders get rewards for the pledges they give you. Take the time to make these rewards awesome. Remember you are starting or continuing a relationship with your supporters, the ones who like you and your idea enough to chip in and get it going. You want to have great rewards that they are excited about. They should be so excited that they automatically want to tell others and bring them in on the story and the offer. These are the folks who are going to be your customers, your word-of-mouth advertising, and your biggest fans. Reward your fans!

%h3 A Goal and a Plan?

%p 
  Set the right goal for exactly what you need to accomplish the project. If you don’t know how much you need, think about, write about it, and sketch out your plans until you have the clarity you need. People want to give to projects when you offer them a clear grasp of what you deliver and how do it. You owe it to yourself and your community to set the right goal, so you all can rally around it together. Remember, unlike other platforms, you aren’t penalized for missing your goal and nothing is stopping you from meeting your goal and charging right past it to greater success. What matters is that your funding goal is attached to a plan that you are ready to carry out. 
  
%h3 A Story?

%p 
  You have to tell a story! People are ready to support you, they just need to know how and why. Tell them!

%h3 Engage Your Networks!
%p 
  To succeed, you have to really put yourself out there. You have to be willing to make a statement. You have to market yourself and you have to market your project. If you want to succeed at crowdfunding, you have to get up at the front of the crowd and speak out so everyone can hear you. Are you ready to get your message out? Can you make the most awesome video the internet has ever seen? Are you willing to ask for help? Are you willing to call the press and tell them what you are doing? Then you are ready to start, let’s get you CloudFunded!

%h3 Finally, Get Your Team in Gear!

%p 
  Tell us about you and anyone who is on your team. People love people. We want to know why you are passionate about this, what you’ve done before that shows how awesome you are, and what you’ve already accomplished in your new venture so far. Your progress to date is called traction. A great team and great traction make a great story. Now, let’s get you started telling it…
