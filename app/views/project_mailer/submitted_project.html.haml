%h3 Thank you for signing up for CloudFunded and launching your listing for #{link_to @project.name, project_url(@project)}.

.p You've come to the right place! 

.p We are so delighted to offer you the tools you need to connect to your community and finance your project through the power of social networking, built on trust and relationships. 

.p Here are the steps you need to take to make your project succeed:

%ul
  %li Tell a good story. Keep refining your profile and make sure it tells the story you want to share!
  %li Use the sharing tools on your profile! Tell your friends, now! Getting your friends on board is what gets your campaign started. People close to you need to know what you’re doing, so they can help. Getting early support from your friends is the key to starting off a solid and successful campaign. 
  %li Spice it up and make it visual! Get a photographer to help you get great photos for your project or spend the time, effort, and even money to make a great video that tells your story! For bonus points and better fundraising, do both. 
  %li Pitch your great rewards! Make sure folks know what they are getting out of supporting you and your project. Can you make your rewards even better? Spend some time thinking about what will bring people in and what you can do for them!
  %li Done all that? Next, tell the press. The key to closing your campaign is going to be getting the word out there. Build on your early support and begin to tell your success story. People will flock to you if you get all these things in line. 

.p We can’t wait to see your project succeed! 

.p Here's the link to your project page: #{project_url(@project)}
